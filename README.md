# Udacity-Project_2 
The code for Udacity's front-end Developer Nanodegree second project: The Landing Page  
## Instructions: 
The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.  
To get started, open js/app.js and start building out the app's functionality.
For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.  

## index.html:
This file represents the skeleton of the landing page. Within the header, you'll find the navigation outlined. Within the body, there are four sections that are added to begin with. Right now, there is simply filler text here but this can be easily fixed in the future. Note the id, class, and data-nav variables and how they are used. This will come into play later on when we create an interactive site.  

## app.js: 
Here is the file where all the functionalities are added. The thing we need to do is to make the page dynamically responsive to clicks.We first go on dynamically building out the navigation. We loop through the number of implemented sections and generate an area in the header for each one. Next is allowing the header to show which section is currently "active" in the page. Finally, this file listens for clicks on the navigation and then scrolls the page to the appropriate section header.  

## styles.css: 
Thank you Udacity for providing the skeleton code.So a larger part of the code has been taken from the skelton code provided by Udacity. This gives the landing page the look and feel that you see and experience.One of the coolest things is the hover animations on the active navigaton header.  

## Launch:
To launch this website, simply clone the repo and open the index.html file in the browser.
